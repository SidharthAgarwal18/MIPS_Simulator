Design Decisions:
1)We have have maintained an array of integers of size 2^20 to act as memory for our assembler. Now instructions of size 4 bytes have been divided into sub-categories and encrypted and decrypted accordingly to be stored in form a 32 bit integer.
since there are 10 possible instructions, this information is stored in 4 consecutive bits from 26 to 30 in the integer.

type_a : add,sub,mul : 
	26-30 bits for unique instruction number assigned
	21-26 bits for register1
	16-21 bits for register2
	11-16 bits for register3
type_b : bne,beq,addi
	26-30 bits for unique instruction number assigned
	21-26 bits for register1
	16-21 bits for register2
	0-16 bits used to store integer for instruction number in case of bne and beq and number to be added in addi
types_c : j
	26-30 bits for unique instruction number assigned
	0-26 bits used to store integer for instruction number

2) we have stored 32 registers in R array and also mapped each register with unique number



We will traverse the given input file(converted into string) line by line and first find the instruction type of the instruction by 
using "find" of c++ stl and then later encrypting the instruction into a 32 bit integer and storing in array.
After reading the complete file we will start traversing the array from instruction 0 and on it's way decrypt every integer
to perform the action required which may even include jumping to another instruction till we are completely done with the last instruction.
