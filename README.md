Computer Architecture Assignments
* In `A1` we obtained the area under a curve formed by joining successive points by a straight line
* In `A2` we wrote a MIPS Assembly Program for evaluating an expression in postfix format.
* In `A3` we wrote a C++ program that reads a MIPS assembly language program as input and executes it.
