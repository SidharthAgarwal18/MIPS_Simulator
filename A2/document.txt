Error-handling 
1) Whenever invalid character is given our program notifies user
2) Whenever an invalid postfix expression is given our program notifies user, like when we find an operator in string traversal
and we have less than 2 numbers in stack, or if in the end we are left with more than one element

Design decisions:
1) we have taken character one by one and checked first wheather its one of the operators, 
if yes then we have computed the result of the particular operation with the last two operands by popping them from stack (if size of stack<2 then raised error)and pushed the result into the stack and if not
if its a digit we have simply pushed the digit into the stack	
and if its neither among digits and operators we have raised an error.
and repeated this process till we have encountered newline("\n").
2) after we have encountered the newline character we have output the single integer (if size!=1 then raised error) left in the stack.
3) t5 register stores the size of stack to take care for the validity of postfix expression.
